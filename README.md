# escape
A coded escape room built quickly

This project was started as a way to disclose the location of a gift during secret santa. 
The code has been rewritten after use to take out personalised info

Since it has been written rather quickly the display of items is sub-par and might not work with some resolutions.

In the future I may adapt the css and ensure that the escape room can be enjoyed by many.

For now it has been a fun project to work on
